## Bugs:
 - [ ] Even when there is a stack in the inventory, new items always appear on the hotbar
 - [ ] Even when there is a stack in the hotbar, new items always appear on the first empty slots available
 - [ ] Water sides are visible on chunk borders (from the outside of the water)
 - [ ] The 1 pixel lower water behaves in strange ways
 - [ ] At high speeds and/or lots of lag, falling items and blocks can phase through blocks
 - [ ] If TNT explodes near water (but not in it), it will explode the water (weirdest sight I've ever seen)
 - [ ] P.S.: Yes, I did learn the last two while exploding my world to death with hundreds of TNT
 - [ ] Sometimes cacti don't understand when to stop and grow incontrollably (hundreds of blocks)
 - [ ] P.S.: The worst part is you can't collapse the massive things for fear of the PC self-descructing
 - [ ] Blocks that are not full blocks (stairs, torches, flowers, ladders, etc.) that are right next to a truly full block, their adjacent face turns black (100% shadow or something). Inverse happens with 1 pix lower solid blocks (path blocks, soul soil..)

### Stupid bugs I caused while messing arond:
 - [ ] Font (VT-13) doesn't work
 - [ ] Skin doesn't work, leaving the character a silvery gray all-over
 - [ ] Commands don't work - every time they freeze the game "too much recursion"
 - [ ] I made bedrock breakable and have no idea how to undo it

## Stuff
 - Did you know that 7 sticks can smelt 3.5 items, but as ladders they can smelt 4.5?
 - Amazingly, if you try igniting a 3 by 3 cube of TNT, it will turn into diamonds instead of exploding - try this in your house sometime.
 - Make a shovel with copper ingots and an amethyst shard and you will get a spyglass! It even works! (Only 1% know this craft)
